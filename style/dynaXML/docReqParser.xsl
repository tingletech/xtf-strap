  When a request is made for a particular document (by specifying docId),
  dynaXML will run the document lookup stylesheet to obtain the source path, 
  stylesheet, branding profile, and authorization info for that document.
  
  Specifically, the stylesheet receives a XSLT parameter $docId 
  containing the document ID as specified in the request URL.
  
  It should output an XML document, which must always contain "style",
  "source", and one or more "auth" tags.
  
  Note that all filesystem paths are relative to the servlet base directory.

    Finally, one or more "auth" sections must be included. These sections 
    will be processed in the order produced until one of them matches.  If 
    none match, access will be denied.
    
    To grant or deny access to everyone, output an auth tag with type 
    "all", like this:
    
    <auth access = ["allow" | "deny"]
    type   = "all"/>
    
    To allow or deny access based on the IP address of the requestor, use 
    the "IP" type like this:
    
    <auth access = ["allow" | "deny"]
    type   = "IP" 
    list   = [URL or file path to a list of IP addresses] />
    
    To allow access to be controlled by an LDAP database, output an auth 
    tag with type "LDAP". There are typically three ways an LDAP database 
    can be used for authentication:
    
    (1) Anonymous bind to the LDAP server, then look up user's record 
    in the database and verify the password. Supply these attributes:
    - server
    - realm
    - queryName  (containing "%" where user name should be placed)
    - matchField (name of field containing password)
    - matchValue (containing "%" where password should be placed)
    
    (2) Bind as administrator to LDAP server using admin password, then
    look up user's record in database and verify their password.
    Supply these attributes:
    - server
    - realm
    - bindName     (the DN of the administrator)
    - bindPassword (the password of the administrator)
    - queryName    (containing "%" where user name should be placed)
    - matchField   (name of field containing password)
    - matchValue   (containing "%" where password should be placed)
    
    (3) Bind to LDAP server using the user's name and password.
    - server
    - realm
    - bindName     (the user's DN, put "%" where user name should go)
    - bindPassword (the string "%" to supply the user's password)
    - queryName    (record to query, often the same as bindName)
    
    <auth access       = "allow"
    type         = "LDAP"
    server       = [URL of LDAP server; begins with "ldap://"]
    realm        = [Description of document collection, shown to
    user when requesting name and password]
    bindName     = [Optional: DN for LDAP bind; string may contain
    "%" which will be replaced by user name]
    bindPassword = [Optional: Password for bind, or use "%" for
    the password entered by the requestor]
    queryName    = [DN to query; string may contain "%" which will
    be replaced by user name]
    matchField   = [Optional: field name to look for]
    matchValue   = [Optional: value to match, "%" to put in the
    user's password]/>
    
    To allow access to be controlled by an external web page (e.g. 
    form-based login, .htpasswd, Shibboleth, etc) output an "external" 
    type auth tag. The external page will receive the following URL 
    parameters:
    
    - returnto    (the URL to return to once authentication is accepted)
    - nonce       (a nonsense string specific to this attempt)
    
    and it must return the following parameters to the "returnto" URL:
    
    - nonce       (the same nonsense string)
    - hash        (hex string MD5 hash of the concatenation of 
    "nonce:key" where key is the shared secret key string)
    
    <auth access = "allow"
    type   = "external" 
    key    = [shared secret key string]
    url    = [URL of the external authentication web page]/>
    -->
    
    <!-- CDL-specific: Since we don't read METS yet, each directory has an 
    authInfo.xml file which has authentication directives.
    
    Note that the path here, since we're reading the file directly, must
    be relative to this stylesheet, *not* to the servlet base directory.
    Hence the "../" below.
    
    If not found, allow access. This is for testing only!
    -->
    
    <auth access="allow" type="all"/>
